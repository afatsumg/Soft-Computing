Istanbul Technical University MKM 502E course assignments and projects

In the first assignment one can find the following algorithms which were implemented in MATLAB,

- Bisection Algorithm
- Golden Selection Algorithm
- Newthon-Raphson Algotitm
- Neural network implementation by using nftool
- Neural network implementation from scratch

In the second assignment a nonlinear CSTR system was taken into account. The control of the CSTR system was performed by using a neuron based nonlinear PID controller and with a TSK type Fuzzy controller in case of different reference signals such as sinusoidal and step. Simulations were done for different parameters for the TSK type FLC. Next, the optimal parameters were found by using genetic algorithms. Finally a function tuner  was used to get a better system response.
